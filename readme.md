    This is a <a href="https://takeaway.com">Takeaway.com</a> code challenge that I named it<strong> Road Runner </strong>.
  </p>
</p>

**Road Runner** was created by [Mohammad Hosein abedi](https://github.com/hoseinz3), and is a fault tolerance email-service.
It sends an email by the high available provider at the moment.

## Overview
- Once an email provider failed, It would be removed from the available providers.
- A simple JSON API for sending emails
- Simple Command-Line tools for sending emails
- Support multiple recipients
- Have a light-weight [Vue-Application](https://github.com/hoseinz3/ui-road-runner)
- Brilliant performance (send email asynchronously with queuing technique)
- Have 95.8 pts in code-quality from [PHP Insights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights)

## ðŸš€ Quick start
**Important:** If you have not the .env file in the root folder, you must copy or rename the .env.example to .env

**Configuring a database**

.env file
```
DB_HOST=mysql #name of Mysql Services in the docker-compose.yml file
```
### Installation
For using Road Runner you have a very easy task to do. Just run below command:

`./start.sh`

It builds the containers and runs commands that Road Runner needs to be up and running.

**Important:** The default port is `8088`

## About code architecture

All codes that related to implementation of mailers are placed in the `Takeaway` folder. there are two types of classes in this folder:

- `AbstractTransport` that is responsible for sending request to mailer's API. it's not coupled to `Guzzle` implementation so it's easy to test.
- MailerTransport such as `SendGridTransport` should provide right data that their API needs.

`TransportInterface` that `AbstractTransport` implemented it tells us what is the functionality of every mailer. 

every mailer that would be implemented have to extends `AbstractTransport`
for example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Takeaway\Transport;

use App\Takeaway\MessageInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

class MailGunTransport extends AbstractTransport
{
    protected $endpoint = '';

    protected $healthCheckEndPoint = '';
    
    protected function getPayload(MessageInterface $message): array
    {
        return [];
    }

    protected function getHeaders(): array
    {
        return [];
    }

    protected function getTrackingId(ResponseInterface $response)
    {
        // parse the $response and return tracking_id that came from mailer
    }
}

```
